Project Title:
*Gravity Maze Solver*

*Overview of the Project:*

This project is a puzzle game where a ball moves inside a grid-based maze. Instead of moving the ball directly, the player rotates the maze to change the direction of gravity. The ball rolls until it hits a wall or reaches the exit. The game uses Python logic for array rotation and basic gravity simulation.

*Features:*

•Rotate maze left or right (90°)

•Ball falls automatically due to gravity

•Walls block movement, exit completes the level

•Simple and interactive gameplay

•Easy-to-add new maze levels

*Technologies / Tools Used:*

Python 3

Optional:

numpy for array rotation

pygame for basic graphics/interface

*Steps to Install & Run the Project:*

1.Install Python 3

2.Download the project folder

3.Install required libraries (if any):

pip install numpy pygame

4.Run the game file:

python gravity_maze.py

*Instructions for Testing*

Try rotating the maze and check if:

1.The ball rolls correctly with gravity

2.Ball stops at walls

3.Ball reaches exit and game ends

4.Test different maze levels to ensure proper working.
